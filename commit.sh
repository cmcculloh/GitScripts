#	@usage commit <message> [-aA]
#
#	@description
#	Commits already-staged work to a branch with a few extra benefits. The branch name
#	is prepended to the commit message so that all commits are easily associated with
#	their branch. The commit summary message is also automatically suppressed.
#
#	Non-staged work can be staged via the available options, which are described below.
#	description@
#
#	@options
#	-a	Automatically stage modified and deleted files before committing.
#	-A	Automatically stage ALL tracked/untracked files before committing.
#	--no-branch-name Do not automatically prepend the commit message with the current branch name
#	--branch-name Prepend the commit message with the current branch name, regardless of user overrides settings.
#	options@
#
#	@notes
#	- The options for this command must come AFTER the message since the -m
#	option is automatically passed to git commit during processing.
#	- If there are untracked files in the working tree and the user passes the -a
#	option, he/she will be prompted to add the untracked files as well.
#	notes@
#
#	@examples
#	1) commit "I know I added some untracked files, so I'll pass the right option" -A

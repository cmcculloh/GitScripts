## /*
#	@description
#	This file is the main controller for all GitScripts. It loads the necessary environment
#	variables, aliases, and scripts that make GitScripts do it's thing. In order for
#	GitScripts to functions properly, you must source this file from your ~/.bashrc,
#	~/.bash_profile, or some other script that loads automatically when you open your
#	CLI.
#
#	Since this file is under source control, you should not make changes to it that you
#	wish to persist. Instead, COPY (since it is also source-controlled) the contents of
#	the cfg/user.overrides.example file into cfg/user.overrides (which you must create)
#	and edit it to your heart's content.
#	description@
#
#	@notes
#	- The user.overrides file is loaded BEFORE the gs.cfg file so that other variables
#	that use previously defined variables in their definition are defined according to
#	user changes. This is because all variables defined in gs.cfg first check for the
#	existence of a variable before defining it.

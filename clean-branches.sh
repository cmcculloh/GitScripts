#	@description
#	This script iterates through your local branches and prompts you to delete
#	branches that are fully merged into master.
#	description@
#
#	@options
#	--base=<branch-name>    By default, the base branch for merged branches is
#	                        master. It can be changed using this option.
#	options@
#
#	@notes
#	- You will end on the same branch you started out on.
#	- To see which branches are already merged into the branch you’re on, you
#	  can run git branch --merged.
#	- To see all the branches that contain work you haven’t yet merged in, you
#	  can run git branch --no-merged.
